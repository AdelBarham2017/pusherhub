Lua Implementation of RFC 6455 and integrated with Pusher.com

The pusher docs are... hard to get through.
http://pusher.com/docs The API/Websocket information is mixed together. 
Some of it may be inaccurate and some details are spread throughout various disparate sections.

RFC I used was http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.3

This library depends on having a Pusher.com account and the Corona SDK (http://coronalabs.com)
This module could probably be adapted for use via the extended LUA libraries. 
I would not know how to do this, so I didn't.

Need help with this? jack9@pusherhub.jack9.org
