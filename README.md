Lua Implementation of RFC 6455 and integrated with Pusher.com

The pusher docs are... hard to get through 
http://pusher.com/docs The API/Websocket information is mixed together. 
Some of it is inaccurate and some details are spread throughout various disparate sections.

RFC I used was http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.3
